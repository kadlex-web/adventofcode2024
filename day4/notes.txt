''' It's not an XMAS solve -- it's an X-MAS solve... where correct values are Xs of MAS.

An example of a valid X.

The sample example would solve to 9 values.

Psuedocode:

Generate a list of A indices using the hash table.
    if hash_table value is equal to "A":
        give me the coordinate and add it to a list called a_list
        
    build a list of possible coordinates the locations could be in 
    [-1,-1], [-1,1], [1,-1] [1,1] are the possible locations for valid X characters
    
    loop through each transform
        for transformation in the transformation list
            evaluate if the value at the coordinate is M -- if its an M
                check and see if the values "adjacent" are M
                    if transform[0] is negative -- we check transform[0] + 2
                    if transform[0] is positive -- we check transform[0] - 2
                    repeat the same for transform[1] to build the two coordinates
                    if one of them is M -- great! we can proceed --
                    if both of them are M -- booo it means its not a valid cross (it would mean the string is MAM)
                    if none of them are M -- boo -- it means we can't build crosses
                    
                    ((maybe build a function which checks the opposite value -- would be useful to run 
        see if the value of the original a coordinate value plus the transformed coordinate value are equal to "MA"
            check and see if the opposite value is a "S"
            
            if transform[0] is less than 1 -- add 1 to the original coordinate
            if transform[0] is greater than 1 -- subtract 1 from the original coordinate
            do the same with transform[1]
            get the hash_table value of that coordinate
            
            if that equals "MAS"
            
            do we even need to loop?? isnt the simplest case that the value in the top corner is an M or S? if its an X or A we already kn
