There are some conditionals within the code do() and dont()
A do() means you can complete mul()
A dont() means you cannot complete mul()
Only the most reason instruction applies
    So if you do() a do() the state continues and we can mul()
    But if it flips it doesnt

Idea:
    If I can introduce a state of 0/1 for the do() / dont() - than operations can be inferred.
    Can I create a dictionary the key is the string in question and the value is a 1 or 0 codifing if the operation is allowed or not
    Than I could filter through the dictionary for only the entries with a value of 1 assigned to a key and perform an operation on those
